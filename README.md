##	What is it 
I use raspberry pi and arduion to setup my ecology mesh project.  
I use Raspberry Pi as my Wireless Station. It receive the data from the zigbee-serial module whick I bought on taobao.  
##	How it works  
I use MySQL to store the data which I received. I have setup up my own communication protocol.  
## What I want to do
I will use the Django framework to setup a website to demonstrate the sensor data, what's more, I will develop my our app to control the device.
## Why I do this
Just for fun
